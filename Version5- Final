This switch statement controls what direction the player moves. When the player enters

"W", "A", "S" or "D", the switch processes the following:

 

If "W" is entered, the new position above the player character ("P") is calculated and

is passed to the "gameFunction" function to continue the processing of the game logic

(see above)

 

If "A" is entered, the new position left the player character ("P") is calculated and

is passed to the "gameFunction" function to continue the processing of the game logic

(see above)

 

If "S" is entered, the new position below the player character ("P") is calculated and

is passed to the "gameFunction" function to continue the processing of the game logic

(see above)

 

If "D" is entered, the new position right the player character ("P") is calculated and

is passed to the "gameFunction" function to continue the processing of the game logic

(see above)

 

If any other key is entered, the game exits and returns to the main menu.
